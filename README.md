## Project Overview

A biological researcher is looking for bacterial species that can synthesize proteins that taste like beef. In partnership with Improbable Beef, a food start-up company, we are researching candidate species. I am creating a dashboard so that volunteers are able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
